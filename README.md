# Measurements with Hakadi 18650 Sodium Ion Cells

The Goal of this project is to provide an overview about what a commercially available Sodium Ion cell is capable of in the end of 2023. As far as I know, Hakadi is the only battery brand selling Sodium based cells to the general Public. For experimental purposes I bought 4 cells in a 18650 package with a claimed capacity of 1500mAh. The datasheet provides the following general specifications:

| Parameter | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Nominal Capacity at 0.5C | 1500mAh |
| Typical Capacity at 0.5C | 1530mAh |
| Charge Voltage |  4.1V |
| Cutoff Voltage | 1.5V |
| Weight | 37.5g |
| Charge Temperature Range | -10-45Â°C |
| Discharge Temperature Range | -30-60Â°C|
| Internal Resistance | <20mOhm |

Notable are the wide voltage range as well as the large temperature range, which supports the claim of Hakadi that this is in fact a real Sodium based battery and not a rebranded Lithium based one. On a first glance, 1500mAh is also on the lower to mid end of available LiFePo based 18650 and not an unrealistic claim as sometimes done by chinese manufacturers.

The research in this reposetory is done by me as a Student with my own, in part self developed, measurement equipment so my capabillity for longer term aging tests, as well as test at temperatures other then room temperature are limited at the moment. I also do research at my University and may link to papers in the future. 

#Testplan

Heres the test plan as well as the current status:

| Test | Progress |
| ---- | ---- |
| Capacity with 0.5C Discharge | <span style="color:grey"> waiting for cells </span> |
| HPPC test with 5% steps | <span style="color:grey"> not in progress </span> |
| incremental charge and discharge OCV | <span style="color:grey"> not in progress </span> |
| Discharge Capacity at various C rates | <span style="color:grey"> not in progress </span> |
| 0V Discharge behaviour | <span style="color:grey"> not in progress </span> |

Hakadi claims that the cells can safely be dicharged and recharged to 0V which is a possibility for Sodium Cells with certain electrolytes and therefore needs to be tested ðŸ˜‰
