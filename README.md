# Measurements with Hakadi 18650 Sodium Ion Cells

## Project Overview

The Goal of this project is to provide an overview about what a commercially available Sodium Ion cell is capable of in the end of 2023. As far as I know, Hakadi is the only battery brand selling Sodium based cells to the general Public. For experimental purposes I bought 4 cells in a 18650 package with a claimed capacity of 1500mAh. The datasheet provides the following general specifications:

| Parameter | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Nominal Capacity at 0.5C | 1500mAh |
| Typical Capacity at 0.5C | 1530mAh |
| Charge Voltage |  4.1V |
| Cutoff Voltage | 1.5V |
| Continuous Charge Rate at 0-45Â°C | 1C |
| Continuous Discharge Rate at 0-45Â°C | 3C |
| Weight | 37.5g |
| Charge Temperature Range | -10-45Â°C |
| Discharge Temperature Range | -30-60Â°C|
| Internal Resistance | <20mOhm |

Notable are the wide voltage range as well as the large temperature range, which supports the claim of Hakadi that this is in fact a real Sodium based battery and not a rebranded Lithium based one. On a first glance, 1500mAh is also on the lower to mid end of available LiFePo based 18650 and not an unrealistic claim as sometimes done by chinese manufacturers.

The research in this reposetory is done by me as a Student with my own, in part self developed, measurement equipment so my capabillity for longer term aging tests, as well as test at temperatures other then room temperature are limited at the moment. I also do research at my University and may link to papers in the future. 

## Testplan

I am currently waiting for the cells from China so no tests are in progress for the moment. Heres the test plan as well as the current status:

| Test | Progress |
| ---- | ---- |
| Capacity with 1C Discharge | <span style="color:grey"> Done </span> |
| Discharge Capacity at various C rates | <span style="color:grey"> not in progress </span> |
| HPPC test with 10% steps | <span style="color:grey"> in progress </span> |
| incremental charge and discharge OCV | <span style="color:grey"> not in progress </span> |
| 0V Discharge behaviour | <span style="color:grey"> not in progress </span> |

All tests are carried out at room temperature. A overview about the testing equipment and its associated limits are provided in the next chapter. Hakadi claims that the cells can safely be dicharged and recharged to 0V which is a possibility for Sodium Cells with certain electrolytes and therefore needs to be tested ðŸ˜‰

## Measurement Equipment

To perform the various tests listed above it is necessary to charge and discharge the cells with a controlled current. To performed the controlled discharge, a self developed electronic load is used. The charge is a bit more tricky, because the charge current needs to be controlled arbitrary so no standard charging IC can be used. Because of the fast change between charge and Discharge pulses for the HPPC, a Lab Bench Power Supply is also no solution for the charge cycle. To solve this problem, a electronic load can be used for the charge cycle as well but with the ground reference "shifted" to the positive terminal voltage of the battery. The "upper" load therefore acts as a voltage controlled current source while the "lower" load acts as a voltage controlled current sink. 

With the loads beeing made from non precise components it is necessary to measure the current going in and out of the battery independently. This is done by using a ACS712-05 Current sense Module which uses the ACS712 Hall based current sensor IC configured to a range of +-5A. The uuput of the current sensor, as well as the voltage of the battery is measured by a ADS1115 16-bit ADC sensor. While the voltage of the current sensor is measured single ended, the battery voltage is measured differentially to provide better accuracy. The sample rate of all values is approx 100ms and the delay between current and voltage measurements is approx 20ms. To mitigate the influence of wiring on impedance measurements, the cell holder provides the option to perform 4-wire measurements of the cell under test.

The setup is controlled by a arduino Nano implementing all necessary controlers. A PC running a python script is used to control the experiment, save log data and communicate with the arduino.

## Results

### Cells arrived!

My four cells arrived with the following voltages:

| Cell | Voltage |
| ---- | ------- |
| Cell 1 | 2.562V |
| Cell 2 | 2.560V |
| Cell 3 | 2.560V |
| Cell 4 | 2.559V |

I measured all cells with a no name, non calibrated 4 1/2 Digit multimeter so the difference might as well come from the measurement equipment

Weight is between 36.53g and 37.00g according to my pocket scale.

### Static capacity tests

The first static capacity test used the following parameters: A CCCV charge to 4.1V with a cut-off current of 0.075mA followed by a CC Discharge with 1C (1500mA) and a CCCV charge with the same parameters as the initial charge. Due to noise issues with the rudamentary cell tester, the charge was terminated a bit earlier near 100mA. Nonetheless the claim of a nominal capacity of 1500mAh seems to be correct with a measured discharge capacity of 1540mAh. Due too the noise, the Coulomb Efficency can not be accuratly determined but is definitly in a range above 99 percent.

The following Figure shows the discharge behaviour at 1C

![Sodium Ion discharge curve at 1C](/Measurement_Data/static_capacity_tests/discharge_curve_1c.jpg) 
Sodium Ion discharge curve at 1C

Note that the voltage decreases nearly linear until 1Ah discharged current after which it plateaus at approx. 2.5V before starting to decrease rapidly. In comparison, a Molicel P45B NCA based cell, which was also tested with the same setup at a sligthly lower C rate can be seen in the Figure below:

![Molicel P45B discharge curve at 2/3C](/Measurement_Data/static_capacity_tests/discharge_curve_molicel_comparison.jpg)
Molicel P45B discharge curve at 2/3C

The NCA based chemistry shows a significantly smaller voltage decrease over SoC and lacks the voltage plateau at a SoC around 30% as well as a higher voltage in general.
In contrast LFP based chemistrys show a nearly flat discharge voltage over the SoC range between 80% and 20%. This leads me to the conclusion that this cells are in fact real Sodium Ion cells and no rebranded Lithium based ones.

### CSV Format descripion

If you want to use the raw csv data, here is a small description of the format:

step: Current Instruction Pointer
mode: Operating Mode
time: Time since the start of the cell tester in milliseconds
voltage: Cell Voltage in V
current: Cell Current in A

Discharge currents have a negative sign, while charging currents have a positive

| Mode Number | Operating Mode |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0 | IDLE |
| 1 | CCCV |
| 2 | Unregulated current pulse |
| 3 | Regulated current pulse |

Unregulated current pulses are used for fast discharges where a PI controller might take too long to stabilize but with lower accuracy

Regulated current charges/discharges are controlled by a PI controller leading too better accuracy but with a small stabilization time
